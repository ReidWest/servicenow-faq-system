## How It Works

1. **Search Process**: Users enter questions in the search form
2. **Keyword Matching**: The application searches the knowledge base using:
   - Exact phrase matching
   - Keyword-based search
   - Partial word matching
3. **Response Generation**: 
   - If a match is found, the corresponding answer is displayed
   - If no match is found, a helpful placeholder response is shown
4. **User Experience**: Clean interface with options to search again or try popular questions

## Customization

### Adding New FAQ Items

To add new questions and answers, edit the `KNOWLEDGE_BASE` dictionary in `app.py`:

```python
KNOWLEDGE_BASE = {
    "your new question": "Your detailed answer here...",
    # ... existing items
}
```

### Modifying the Placeholder Response

Update the placeholder response in the `search()` function in `app.py`:

```python
placeholder_response = ("Your custom message here...")
```

### Styling Changes

Modify `static/css/style.css` to change the appearance of the application.

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Flask 2.3.3
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with responsive design
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.0.0
- **Search Algorithm**: Keyword matching with fallback responses

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: If port 5000 is occupied, modify the port in `app.py`:
   ```python
   app.run(debug=True, host='127.0.0.1', port=5001)
   ```

2. **Module not found errors**: Ensure virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Template not found**: Make sure you're running the app from the correct directory where `app.py` is located.

### Development Mode

The application runs in debug mode by default, which provides:
- Auto-reload when files change
- Detailed error messages
- Interactive debugger

For production deployment, set `debug=False` in `app.py`.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the application:
- Database integration for dynamic FAQ management
- User authentication and role-based access
- Analytics and search logging
- Admin panel for content management
- Integration with ticketing systems (ServiceNow)
- Multi-language support
- Advanced search with synonyms and typo tolerance
